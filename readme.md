The (hopefully) final form of my personal homelab for quite a while.

## ðŸ§± The Hardware

### Networking

As a [Ubiquiti](https://www.ui.com) fanboy, of course my home network is headed by a [Dream Machine Special Edition](https://store.ui.com/us/en/collections/unifi-dream-machine/products/udm-se). Add to that a couple of [U6 Pros](https://store.ui.com/us/en/collections/unifi-wifi-flagship-high-capacity/products/u6-pro) and a scattering of [Switch 8 PoE (60W)](https://store.ui.com/us/en/products/us-8-60w) for some ethernet goodness and you've got from my experience a rock-solid prosumer network.

### Compute

I picked up a couple of second hand [Dell Optiplex 7070 Micro](https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-au/optiplex-7070-micro/opti7070_micro_setup_specs/system-specifications) PCs to use as Proxmox hosts. Each of these is packed with an Intel i5 9500T, 16GB Memory, and 256GB of SSD storage. I've also got a few old Samsung 840 PRO 256GB drives laying around to throw one in each. Based on what I'm currently running, these should serve me well for the next few years (probably not though).

### Storage

This part is a little tbd. Currently I'm waiting on [Ubiquiti](https://www.ui.com) to release a NAS. However, there's a solid chance I'll cave soon and build a server to run [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com). Until all of that though, I've picked up a [Orico 3.5in External Hard Drive Enclosure](https://www.orico.cc/usmobile/product/detail/id/3518) to throw an old [Seagate IronWolf Pro 8TB](https://www.seagate.com/au/en/products/nas-drives/ironwolf-pro-hard-drive) drive in, which I'm going to front with [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com) to learn a bit about it. That should tide me over for a while.
